    Over the spring 4u business pilot, the team kickstarted production towards a tight deadline of February 14th. With the goal of launching their first MVP in time for Valentines Day, the process of developing the product was streamlined for efficiency. With this decision, 4U learned a lot about production, marketing, management, and audience insights. 
    In regards to our target customer base, there are a couple different groups that we highlighted. First, there is a niche group of people who care about gift giving and generosity towards others. This is a small group but a constant one, that is consistent whether or not there is a large consumer event such as Valentines Day. On the flip side, there are large consumer groups for these major holidays, however, engagement throughout the rest of the year is low. Finally, with our various launches, we have seen the appeal for good marketing and trendy packaging, and that this really drives consumer rates up. 
    Additionally, we had two in person marketing activations which we saw were very receptive with our target market. One, leaving flowers around college campuses with our instagram handle, which we could see drove social engagement and interest up. Two, we gave out flowers to strangers in person, which was aimed at a more general market. 
    We learned that with this type of market, Flowers have an inherent gifting value, where everyone feels happy and gets a benefit, additionally, in a surveyed group, you will see that most people like flowers. With this comes the flipside, where active marketing is necessary to keep people engaged with a product they are giving away. Some things that we learned were that if miscommunication is possible, it will most likely happen, so it is a good idea to take everything step by step and make sure everything is simple for consumers. In regards to pre orders, we learned that it doesn't work for the target market, however with specific events and dates like Valentines day, this is extremely popular.
    With this spring pilot, we would have loved to have been more flexible with goals and changing internal roles when necessary, spend more times optimizing materials, for example, when is good to go with what you have vs time to change, have more time to establish our in a way that is not around an event like valentines day, and focus on what people really like, like our packaging.
    For our future, we really want to focus on creating more of a framework as well as standardizing systems and packaging as we step back into a management role.
